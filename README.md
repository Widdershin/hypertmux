# hypertmux

hypertmux is an experimental terminal emulator, designed to allow tmux users to be able to open web pages inside of tmux panes.

My goal is to produce a standalone tmux client app, built on top of electron. Currently I have a prototype that runs in the browser.

Why?

Well, since I use console neovim as my editor, I pretty much live my life inside of a fullscreen tmux session. The only other necessary part of my development workflow is a browser. So I want one inside of tmux!
