# hypertmux

hypertmux is an experimental terminal emulator, designed to allow tmux users to be able to open web pages inside of tmux panes.

Why?
---

Well, since I use console neovim as my editor, I pretty much live my life inside of a fullscreen tmux session. The only other necessary part of my development workflow is a browser. So I want one inside of tmux!


Installation
---

**hypertmux is pre-alpha quality software. You can install it, but expect bugs.**

First, ensure you have tmux v2.2+ and npm available.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Widdershin/hypertmux.git

$ npm install

$ npm start
```

A hypertmux window should open. You can pin the icon to your system dock and then open from there in the future if you like.
